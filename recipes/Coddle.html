<h1><em> Tummy Warming Coddle </em></h1>
<p>There is no one true recipe. Like most stews, every family puts into it whatever they like, or whatever’s available. </p>
<p>I suggest using garlic, or carrots, or parsley. I prefer the basic 4 ingredient recipe, but like I say, use what you or your family like in the dish. It’s not as if there was a Coddle Inspector going around knocking on doors and checking, is it?</p>
